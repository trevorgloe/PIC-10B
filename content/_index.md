    "title" : "PIC 10A: Introduction to Programming in C++"
} 

This is the web manifestation of Prof. Michael Andrews' second C++ textbook for UCLA's PIC10B class. It was created by Hunter Liu and Trevor Loe, giving an alternative to the PDF option. The goal is to provide a document that's 
1. easy to copy/paste from, 
2. easy to jump around in, and 
3. easy to reference externally. 

Of course, websites are not printer-friendly and require an internet connection to access, contrary to PDF textbooks. 

Besides the medium it's transmitted in, the content should be essentially identical to the PDF copy.
